            <h2>Fun facts about ibises</h2>
            <p>
                The Australian White Ibis (Threskiornis molucca) is a native Australian bird and is protected under State Wildlife Legislation (Nature Conservation Act 1992). It is a serious offence to harm an ibis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ibis plays an important role in natural pest management as it preys on small insects and grubs. While increasing population must be managed, their long-term conservation is necessary for maintaining the variety of all plants and animals. 
            </p>

                Ibis are fairly large and grow up to 75 centimetres in length. They have:
                <ul>
                    <li>long curved black beaks</li>
                    <li>white bodies with black feathers near the tail</li>
                    <li>pink to pinkish-black legs</li>
                    <li>a naked and black head and neck, with pink bands on the nape.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Useful facts about ibises</h2>
            <p>
                Although ibises are protected from harm by state legislation, it is a little known fact of <b>Brisbane Council</b> law that they are also free.
            </p>
            <p>
                An individual may forage as many ibises (or ibii) as they can fit within a standard issue hessian sack, so long as they ensure to leave enough to maintain a stable breeding population. Since ibises are the main predators of cigarette butts, a drop in the local ibis population could cause major ecological damage. With no ibises to gag down cigarette butts out of the bin, rivers and parks would become overrun, causing knock-on effects throughout the food-chain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the ibises gathered in this manner are not allowed to be harmed, they make can serve many useful and exciting purposes:
                <ul>
                    <li>they make excellent garden gnomes</li>
                    <li>they can be used as a prop in a Brisbane-themed pirate costume</li>
                    <li>enough ibises together can be used to power a treadmill or sleigh</li>
                    <li>with a splash of paint, they liven up a fancy garden party in place of peacocks (which are much more expensive).</li>
                </ul>
